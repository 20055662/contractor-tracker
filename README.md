# Recruitment System App

This is my **Recruitment System App**, a desktop application I built using **C# and WPF** to help manage contractors and jobs.  
It’s a project I created as part of my learning journey to practice **object-oriented programming, UI design, and unit testing**.

---

## What it does
- Add and manage **contractors** with names, start dates, and hourly wages  
- Add and manage **jobs** with titles, dates, and costs  
- **Assign jobs** to contractors and track who’s working on what  
- **Complete jobs** and keep a record of assigned vs completed tasks  
- A **simple WPF UI** to interact with everything  
- Unit-tested core features using **MSTest**

## Tech I used
- **C# & .NET** – OOP all the way!  
- **WPF (XAML)** – For building the desktop interface  
- **MSTest** – To make sure my code works as expected  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and tracking changes  
- **Visual Studio 2022** – IDE of choice
